 * This traffic generator simply sends data
 * as fast as possible up to MaxBytes or until
 * the appplication is stopped if MaxBytes is
 * zero. Once the lower layer send buffer is
 * filled, it waits until space is free to
 * send more data, essentially keeping a
 * constant flow of data. Only SOCK_STREAM 
 * and SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets are supported. 
 * For example, TCP sockets can be used, but 
 * UDP sockets can not be used.
